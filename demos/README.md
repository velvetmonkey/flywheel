## Getting Started

1. Navigate to a demo vault:
```bash
cd demos/carter-strategy
```

2. Create `.mcp.json` with Flywheel configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flywheel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@velvetmonkey/flywheel-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Start Claude Code and verify connection:
```
mcp__flywheel__health_check()
```

Then start asking questions about the business.
