# Onboard Customer

Create a new customer onboarding checklist from template, with customer details pre-filled.

## Trigger Detection

Activate when user:
- Has a new customer to onboard
- Needs to create an onboarding checklist
- Wants to start customer setup process

## Examples

- "Onboard Acme Corp"
- "New customer: TechStart Inc"
- "Create onboarding checklist for Big Enterprise"
- "Start onboarding for [[New Client]]"

## Process

1. **Parse Customer Name**
   - Extract customer name from request
   - If unclear, ask for confirmation

2. **Delegate to Agent**
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="customer-onboarding-agent",
       description="Onboard customer",
       prompt="Create onboarding checklist for [Customer Name]"
   )
   ```

3. **Confirm Creation**
   - Show created note path
   - Link to related resources

## Customization

The onboarding template can be customized:
- Edit `templates/customer-onboarding.md` for your workflow
- Add/remove checklist phases
- Include company-specific steps
