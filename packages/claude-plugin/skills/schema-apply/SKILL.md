# Schema Application

Apply inferred conventions to incomplete notes. Suggests and adds missing fields based on what similar notes have.

## When to Use

Invoke when you want to:
- Add missing frontmatter fields to notes
- Batch-fix incomplete metadata
- Apply folder conventions to outliers
- Normalize notes to match their peers

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| folder | No | Folder to apply schema to. Omit for entire vault. |
| path | No | Specific note to fix. Takes precedence over folder. |

## Process

### 1. Parse User Input

Recognize application requests:
- "apply inferred schema to incomplete notes"
- "add missing fields to meetings/"
- "fix incomplete notes in projects/"

### 2. Find Incomplete Notes

```
mcp__flywheel__find_incomplete_notes({
  folder: "meetings/",
  min_frequency: 0.7
})
```

### 3. Preview Changes

```
## Schema Application Preview

I'll add missing fields based on inferred conventions:

### meetings/2025-12-20 Client Call.md
Adding:
```yaml
attendees:
  - [[Sarah Chen]]
  - [[Marcus Johnson]]
tags:
  - meeting
  - client
```

### meetings/2025-12-22 Quick Sync.md
Adding:
```yaml
tags:
  - meeting
  - standup
```

**Proceed with these changes?** (y/n)
```

### 4. Apply Changes (with confirmation)

Use Read to get current content, Edit to add fields.

### 5. Verify Changes (Gate 6)

After each Edit:
1. **Re-read the modified file** to verify changes
2. **Check if the new fields are present** in frontmatter
3. **Handle failures**:
   - If Edit is blocked or failed: Inform user and skip to next file
   - If fields not found after edit: Alert user "Edit may have failed"
   - If succeeded: Only report success if verification confirms the fields were added

### 6. Report Results

```
## Schema Application Complete

Applied to 3 notes:
✓ meetings/2025-12-20 Client Call.md - 2 fields added
✓ meetings/2025-12-22 Quick Sync.md - 1 field added
✗ meetings/2025-12-23 Standup.md - Edit blocked (permission denied)

If any edits failed, you can apply them manually.
```

## Six Gates Compliance

| Gate | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| 1. Read Before Write | Reads current file before any changes |
| 2. File Exists | Validates file exists via find_incomplete_notes |
| 3. Chain Validation | N/A (single step) |
| 4. Mutation Confirmation | Always shows preview, requires confirmation |
| 5. Health Check | Uses MCP health infrastructure |
| 6. Post Validation | Re-reads file after Edit, verifies fields present |

## Use Cases

- **Batch normalization**: "Make all meeting notes consistent"
- **New note completion**: "Add standard fields to my new note"
- **Migration support**: "Ensure all notes have required fields"

## Integration

Works well with other skills:
- **schema-infer**: See what fields will be applied
- **schema-gaps**: Find notes needing fixes
- **promote-frontmatter**: Extract prose patterns first
