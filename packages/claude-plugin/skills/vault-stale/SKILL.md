# Stale Notes

Find important notes that haven't been updated recently.

## Purpose

Stale notes are:
- **Important** (have many backlinks = widely referenced)
- **Outdated** (not modified in 60+ days)

These may need review, updates, or archiving.

## What Makes a Note "Important"?

- Has 5+ backlinks (widely referenced)
- OR has specific tags (#project, #active)
- OR in key folders (work/projects/, tech/)

## Process

### 1. Get Recent Activity

```javascript
recent_notes = get_recent_notes(days=60)
all_notes = search_notes({})

stale_candidates = all_notes - recent_notes
```

### 2. Filter for Important Notes

```javascript
stale_important = []

for note in stale_candidates:
  backlinks = get_backlinks(note)

  if backlinks.count >= 5:
    stale_important.append({
      path: note.path,
      backlinks: backlinks.count,
      last_modified: note.modified,
      days_stale: (today - note.modified).days
    })
```

### 3. Sort by Importance

Sort by backlink count (most referenced first).

### 4. Report Results

```

## Recommended Actions

**For each stale note:**
1. **Review**: Read and assess if still relevant
2. **Update**: Refresh outdated information
3. **Archive**: Move to archive/ if no longer needed
4. **Link**: Add to current work if relevant
5. **Tag**: Add `#reviewed/YYYY-MM-DD` frontmatter

## Ignore Patterns

Don't flag as stale:
- Daily/weekly/monthly notes (intentionally historical)
- Archive folders
- Reference material (timeless)
- Meeting notes (historical record)
