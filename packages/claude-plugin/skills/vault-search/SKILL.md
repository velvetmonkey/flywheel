# Search Skill

Advanced vault search with powerful filtering using Flywheel MCP.

## Purpose

Comprehensive search interface to your vault with support for:
- Folder filtering (search within specific folders)
- Tag filtering (has_tag, has_all_tags, has_any_tag)
- Frontmatter filtering (where: {key: value})
- Title search (title_contains)
- Sorting (modified, created, title)
- Pagination (limit, order)

Goes far beyond basic text search - this is semantic, metadata-aware search.

## When to Use

Invoke when you want to:
- **Find notes**: "search for X" or "find notes about Y"
- **Filter by folder**: "notes in work/" or "search tech folder"
- **Filter by tags**: "notes with #project" or "tagged work and azure"
- **Filter by metadata**: "notes with status active" or "type project"
- **Recent notes**: "notes modified this week" or "recent changes"

## Process

### 1. Parse User Query

Extract search parameters from natural language:

**Examples:**
```
"search for databricks"
  → title_contains: "databricks"

"notes in work/ tagged project"
  → folder: "work/", has_tag: "project"

"recent notes with status active"
  → sort_by: "modified", where: {status: "active"}
```

### 2. Call MCP Tool

```
Call: mcp__flywheel__search_notes
Parameters: {
  folder: "work/",
  has_tag: "project",
  title_contains: "databricks",
  sort_by: "modified",
  order: "desc",
  limit: 50
}
```

### 3. Display Results

```
