# Vault Task List

Get all tasks from your vault with filtering options.

## When to Use

Invoke when you want to:
- See all open tasks across the vault
- Filter tasks by folder, tag, or status
- Quick task overview when outside Obsidian
- Complement Dataview task queries

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `status` | No | "all" | Filter: "open", "completed", "cancelled", "all" |
| `folder` | No | - | Limit to notes in this folder |
| `tag` | No | - | Filter to tasks with this tag |
| `limit` | No | 100 | Maximum tasks to return |

## Process

### 1. Parse User Input

Identify filter criteria:
- "show all open tasks"
- "tasks in the projects/ folder"
- "completed tasks with #task tag"
- "list tasks from work notes"

### 2. Call MCP Tool

```
mcp__flywheel__get_all_tasks(
  status: "open",
  folder: "projects/",
  tag: "#task",
  limit: 50
)
```

### 3. Format Results

## Relationship to Dataview

| Tool | Use Case | When |
|------|----------|------|
| **Dataview (Obsidian)** | Rich queries, live views | In Obsidian |
| **vault-tasks (Claude)** | Quick overview, CLI access | Outside Obsidian |

This skill **complements** your Dataview workflow:
- Use when chatting with Claude about tasks
- Quick checks without opening Obsidian
- Cross-reference with other Claude tools

## Task Syntax Supported

The skill recognizes Obsidian checkbox syntax:
- `- [ ]` Open task
- `- [x]` Completed task
- `- [-]` Cancelled task
- `- [/]` In progress (treated as open)

Due date formats:
- `📅 2026-01-05` (emoji format)
- `due: 2026-01-05` (text format)
- `[due:: 2026-01-05]` (Dataview format)

## Use Cases

- **Morning check**: "What tasks are open?"
- **Folder focus**: "Tasks in my work/ folder"
- **Tag filter**: "Show #urgent tasks"
- **Progress tracking**: "How many tasks completed this week?"

## Integration

Works well with other skills:
- **vault-due**: Focus on deadline-based view
- **task-add**: Add new tasks to daily notes
- **vault-search**: Find notes by task status
- **vault-activity**: Correlate tasks with activity
