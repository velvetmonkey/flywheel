# Concurrent Notes Finder

Find notes that were edited around the same time as a reference note.

## When to Use

Invoke when you want to:
- Reconstruct context: "What was I working on when I wrote this?"
- Find related work from the same session
- Identify notes that might be conceptually related (edited together)
- Understand your workflow patterns

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | - | Path to the reference note |
| `hours` | No | 24 | Time window in hours (before and after) |

## Process

### 1. Parse User Input

Identify the reference note and time window:
- "what else was I editing when I wrote [[Project Alpha]]?"
- "notes edited around the same time as today's daily note"
- "concurrent notes within 4 hours of this meeting note"

### 2. Call MCP Tool

```
mcp__smoking-mirror__get_contemporaneous_notes(
  path: "projects/Project Alpha.md",
  hours: 24
)
```

### 3. Format Results

```
Concurrent Notes
=================================================

Reference: [[Isolated Note]]
Modified: 2024-06-15 03:45:00
Window: ±24 hours

No other notes modified in this period.

This was an isolated editing session.

Possible reasons:
  - Late night/early morning work
  - One-off note creation
  - Vault was new at this time

=================================================
```

## Understanding Time Windows

| Window | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 1 hour | Same work session |
| 4 hours | Same focus block |
| 24 hours | Same day/night cycle |
| 72 hours | Same project sprint |

## Use Cases

- **Context recovery**: "What was I researching when I wrote this?"
- **Session reconstruction**: "Show my work session from that day"
- **Relationship discovery**: "Find notes I edited together"
- **Workflow analysis**: "How do I work across notes?"

## Integration

Works well with other skills:
- **vault-activity**: Get broader activity patterns
- **vault-path**: Check if concurrent notes are linked
- **vault-common**: Find shared references among concurrent notes
- **vault-backlinks**: See if concurrent notes reference each other
