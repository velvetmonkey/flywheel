# Flywheel Documentation

Query your markdown vault like a database.

**[Query Guide](QUERY_GUIDE.md)** | **[MCP Tools](MCP_REFERENCE.md)** | **[Demo Vaults](../demos/)**

## Query Your Vault

Ask questions—Flywheel queries the graph index, not your files.

### Graph Intelligence

```
"What's blocking the propulsion milestone?"

Flywheel traverses:
  Propulsion Milestone → depends on → Turbopump Test
  Turbopump Test → blocked by → Seal Supplier Delay

Answer in ~50 tokens (vs 5,000+ reading files)
```

### Temporal Queries

```
"What changed in the last 7 days?"
"Find stale notes—important but neglected"
"Show notes edited around the same time as [[This Note]]"
```

### Schema Queries

```
"What fields exist in projects/?"
"Find notes where status is 'blocked'"
"Show all unique client values"
```
